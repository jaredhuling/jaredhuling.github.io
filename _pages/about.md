My research interests focus on the development of precision medicine, causal inference, and statistical learning methodology for the analysis of complex observational studies.
I am particularly interested in addressing various forms of population heterogeneity with the aim of improving patient health outcomes. My work in this area has involved applications in health system risk modeling and in personalizing health system intervention enrollment decisions. My research also includes methodological and computational developments with the aim of flexibly modeling highly complex and/or large-scale data.
