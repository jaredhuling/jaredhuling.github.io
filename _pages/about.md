My research interests focus on the development of methods in precision medicine, causal inference, and statistical learning for the analysis of complex observational studies.
I am particularly interested in addressing various forms of population heterogeneity with the aim of improving patient and health outcomes. My work in this area has involved applications in hospital system risk modeling and in personalizing hospital intervention enrollment decisions. My research also includes methodological developments with the aim of flexibly modeling highly-complex data. Computational aspects of my work are also motivated by the analysis of complex and large-scale data.
