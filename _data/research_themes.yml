  title: Causal Inference
  description: >
    Development of principled methods for estimating causal effects from
    observational data. Topics include weighting methods for continuous and
    binary treatments, modified treatment policies, energy-based balancing
    approaches, and handling violations of positivity and other standard
    causal assumptions such as positivity violations.
